## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to set css custom properties. How I made it in this project:

```css
:root {
    --white-clr: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

    --font-size-paragraph: 15px;
}
```

The ```:root``` pseudo-class to make my variables fall in all the others elements, because of the cascade.

### Continued development

These are the things I still need to get better at or study more about:

- Study more about fallback fonts;

### Useful resources

[CSS Custom Properties introduction](https://www.example.com) - This video, by Kevin Powell, helped me to undestand how css custom variables, aka css variables, are defined. This guy is amazing.

<!--- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
